abstract = "We present a new method for accelerating matrix multiplication asymptotically. Thiswork builds on recent ideas of Volker Strassen, by using a basic trilinear form which is not a matrix product. We make novel use of the Salem-Spencer Theorem, which gives a fairly dense set of integers with no three-term arithmetic progression. Our resulting matrix exponent is 2.376."

Assuming that log⁡d=O(n) and that M(n)/(nlog⁡n) is increasing, we prove that d×d matrices with n-bit integer entries may be multiplied inO(d2M(n)+dωn2O(lg⁎⁡n−lg⁎⁡d)M(lg⁡d)/lg⁡d) bit operations. In particular, if n is large compared to d, say d=O(log⁡n), then the complexity is only O(d2M(n))."
